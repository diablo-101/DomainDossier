Are you interested in web security and want to test your skills against potential domain information gathering? If so, you've come to the right place! This project is a comprehensive Python script, meticulously designed for the purpose of probing domain information. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this tool will help you discover new ways to gather domain information and access restricted resources.

## Features

1. **Domain Information Retrieval**: It retrieves and displays detailed information about a specific domain. The information includes:
   - Nameservers
   - Creation date
   - Expiration date
   - HTTP status code
   - IP address
   - Web server
   - Hosting provider
   - Real hostname

2. **Single Domain or Wordlist Input**: The script allows you to input either a single domain or a wordlist file containing multiple domains. This is useful for batch processing of multiple domains.

3. **Pretty Output**: The script uses the PrettyTable library to format the output in a neat, tabular structure, making it easy to read and understand.

4. **Output to File**: The script provides an option to save the output to a file. This is useful for record-keeping and future reference.

5. **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and provide useful feedback when an error occurs.

## Installation
